*THIS CODE MUST BE RUN ON THE QUANTCONNECT PLATFORM TO USE ITS LIBARIES*

Strategy:

Buy 100 shares of SPY at the start.
Every month, sell a covered call (1-month expiration, delta â‰¤ 0.25).
Collect the premium and reinvest it by buying more shares of SPY.
Once the number of shares reaches an additional 100, start selling 2 covered calls.
Implement a stop-loss to manage risk on the covered calls.


Key points:

### Reinvest Premium:

In the OnOrderEvent method, the premium from selling options is calculated and used to buy more SPY shares.
This ensures that the premium received from selling covered calls is reinvested to accumulate more shares of SPY.

### Dynamic Covered Calls:

The number of shares owned is calculated using self.Portfolio[self.spy].Quantity. The number of covered calls to sell is determined by dividing this number by 100 (num_calls = spy_shares // 100).
This way, if you have 200 shares, you'll sell 2 covered calls, and so on.

### Monthly Execution:

The code keeps track of when to sell the next round of covered calls using the variable self.next_call_date and updates it each month.
